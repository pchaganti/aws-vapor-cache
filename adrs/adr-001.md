## ADR Number: 001

## Title: In-Memory Storage

## Date: 2025-02-9

## Status: Accepted

## Context
The application requires an in-memory caching solution to do its main job. Key requirements include:
1. **Thread safety and concurrency** to handle multiple client connections.
2. **Weighted size-based eviction** to enable proper size-based memory management and eviction.
3. **Expiration policies** to support TTL on database entries.

Several Rust caching libraries were evaluated, and a decision was made to select Moka despite its trade-offs.

## Decision
The **Moka** library will be used for in-memory caching.

**Primary Reasons**:
1. **Thread-safe and concurrent**: Moka supports high-throughput, thread-safe operations, critical for multi-threaded applications.
2. **Weighted size-based eviction**: Allows fine-grained control over cache entries (e.g., large entries can count more toward eviction thresholds).
3. **Expiration policies**: Supports time-to-live (TTL) and time-to-idle (TTI) policies out of the box.

**Trade-Off**:
- Moka increases the final binary size by **~2MB**, which is deemed acceptable given the feature requirements.

This ADR reflects a deliberate choice to prioritize functionality over binary size, aligning with the application’s performance and scalability goals.

## Alternatives Considered

| Library       | Pros                        | Cons                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `cached`      | Simple API, lightweight     | Not concurrent                  |
| `mini-moka`   | Smaller footprint than Moka | Lacks async support             |
| `quick-cache` | High performance            | No built-in expiration policies |

**Analysis**:  
- `cached` was rejected due to lack of thread safety.
- `mini-moka` (a lightweight fork of Moka) was rejected because async support is required for the application’s runtime.
- `quick-cache` lacks expiration policies, which are non-negotiable for the use case.


## Consequences
1. **Binary Size**: The application’s binary size increases by ~2MB.
2. **Feature Guarantees**: Moka’s thread safety, eviction, and expiration features address core requirements.
3. **Maintainability**: Moka is actively maintained, reducing long-term risk.
